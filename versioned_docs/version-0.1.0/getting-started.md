# Getting Started

## What is Blueprint System?

A Flutter library that creates an intractable view with __nodes__ (child widgets) that may be added to it. These nodes can be __moved__, __resized__, and __modified__. âš¡<br/>

## Installation

- ### Method 1 (Recommended)

  run this line in your terminal:

  ```bash
  flutter pub add blueprint_system
  ```
- ### Method 2

  add this line to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

  ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
  dependencies:
  // highlight-start
    blueprint_system: 0.1.0
  // highlight-end
  ```

  then get packages, (Alternatively, your editor might support this)

  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  ```

## Additional information

This package is still under development and I will do my best to make it more stable.  
If you encounter any bugs, please **[file an issue](https://github.com/salah-rashad/blueprint_system/issues/new)** and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.  
Pull requests are always welcome! ðŸ¦„



<!-- # Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
