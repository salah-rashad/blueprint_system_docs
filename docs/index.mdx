# Getting Started

## What is Blueprint System?

A Flutter library that creates an intractable view with **nodes** (child widgets) that may be added to it. These nodes can be **moved**, **resized**, and **modified**.

<!-- TODO: add features -->

## Features

<Feature>
  Adding nodes as much as you want and control them anywhere in the project.
</Feature>
<Feature>
  <code>FixedNode</code>: A node that will remain in its predetermined position
  and cannot be moved with user interactions.
</Feature>
<Feature>
  <code>DraggableNode</code>: A node that can be moved anywhere in the Blueprint
  with user interaction (drag & drop).
</Feature>
<Feature>
  <code>FloatingNode</code>: A node that will stick to the screen and will not
  change in interaction with the Blueprint or any other interactions unless you
  add some modifications to its properties.
</Feature>
<Feature>
  Blueprint <code>zoom in/out</code> & <code>pan</code>.
</Feature>
<Feature>
  Blueprint has <code>rulers</code> to help the user determine the coordinates
  of the view. It dynamically changes as you zoom in and out: when you zoom in,
  the ruler's precision increases; when you zoom out, the precision decreases.
</Feature>
<Feature>
  Blueprint includes <code>grid paper</code> as a background with (100x100) line
  intervals, and you may change the <code>background colour</code>,{" "}
  <code>show/hide</code> the grid, and <code>snap nodes</code> to the grid.
</Feature>

## Installation

- ### Method 1 (Recommended)

  run this line in your terminal:

- ### Method 2

  add this line to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

  ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
  dependencies:

    blueprint_system: 0.1.0
  // highlight-end
  ```

  then get packages, (Alternatively, your editor might support this)

  ```bash
  flutter pub get
